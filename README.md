My First TOP project using HTML only.  

This consists of an index page with links to three different recipe pages.

I already have some experience with html, but in this specific project (and with TOP), I learnt:

- how to link to relative paths using '..'

- what a webp file is and the fact that it can be used just like jpgs (had never heard of this type of file before)
