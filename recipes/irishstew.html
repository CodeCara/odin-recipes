    <h2>Traditional Irish Stew</h2>
    <p>Irish stew is made with lamb. Every Irish household has its own recipe for this famous dish. I like to add chunky pieces of parsnip for a little sweetness and fresh rosemary for a distinct flavor and aroma. Fantastic on St. Patrick's Day served with a pint of the black stuff, of course!</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Oil: Cook the lamb in a tablespoon of olive oil.</li>
       <li>Lamb shoulder: Traditional Irish stew is made with lamb, but you can use boneless beef chuck if you prefer.</li>
        <li>Seasonings: Season the meat with salt and pepper. Fresh rosemary gives the stew flavor, while a fresh parsley garnish adds a pop of color.</li>
        <li>Vegetables: Youâ€™ll need an onion, carrots, a parsnip, potatoes, and leeks for this hearty Irish stew. </li>
        <li>Water: The broth starts with four cups of water. </li>
       
        
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Cook the lamb pieces until evenly browned, then season with salt and pepper. </li>
        <li>Add the onion, carrots, and parsnips, then stir in the water. Cover and bring to a boil.</li>
        <li>Reduce the heat and simmer until lamb is tender. </li>
        <li>Stir in the potatoes and simmer, then add the leeks and rosemary. </li>
        <li>Continue to simmer uncovered, until potatoes are tender.</li>
        <li>Serve garnished with parsley.</li>
    </ol>
