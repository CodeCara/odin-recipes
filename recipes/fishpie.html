<h2>Easy Fish Pie</h2>
<p>This fish pie is good enough for a dinner party and the kids love it too. Living by the sea, we try to eat fish often, and this hearty meal is an easy way to enjoy a little bit of what you fancy! Serve with a green salad or a green steamed vegetable like broccoli.</p>
<h3>Ingredients</h3>
<ul>
    <li>6 medium potatoes</li>
   <li>½ cup butter, divided</li>
    <li>1 medium white Spanish onion, chopped</li>
    <li>1 ½ cups grated medium Cheddar cheese</li>
    <li>1 ¼ cups light cream, or as needed</li>
    <li>2 teaspoons Dijon mustard</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon lemon juice</li>
    <li>Salt and ground black pepper to taste</li>
    <li>1 ½ pounds white fish - skinned, boned, and cut into chunks</li>
    <li>½ pound fresh shrimp, peeled and deveined</li>
    <li>salt and ground black pepper to taste</li>
</ul>
<h3>Steps</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Cut a small slit in each potato and place onto a baking sheet.</li>
    <li>Bake in the preheated oven until potatoes are easily pierced with a fork, about 1 hour and 10 minutes.</li>
    <li>When the potatoes are almost finished, melt 1/4 cup butter in a skillet over medium heat. Add onion; cook and stir until softened and translucent, about 5 minutes. Mix in Cheddar, cream, mustard, and lemon juice; season with salt and pepper. Cook, stirring frequently, until sauce is warm and Cheddar has melted, 3 to 5 minutes. Remove from the heat.</li>
    <li>Place white fish and shrimp into a 3 1/2-quart oven-proof baking dish. Pour cheese sauce over fish and stir until well combined.</li>
    <li>Scoop flesh out of baked potatoes and place into a large bowl; discard the skins. Add remaining 1/4 cup butter; season with salt and pepper. Mash with a fork until butter has melted and potatoes are smooth. Spread mashed potatoes evenly over fish.</li>
    <li>Return to the oven and bake until sauce is bubbling and potato topping is golden brown, about 55 minutes.</li>
</ol>
